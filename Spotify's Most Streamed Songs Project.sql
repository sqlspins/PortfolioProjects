/*
The BPM Effect: Success Among Spotifyâ€™s Most-Streamed Songs  

Skills used: 
- **Joins**: Used to combine data from multiple rows within the same table (such as `self-joins`) and to merge data across tables with `INNER JOIN`. This was particularly useful for correlating multiple attributes (such as BPM and streaming metrics) for each song.
- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**: Implemented CTEs to simplify complex queries, such as categorizing songs into BPM ranges, calculating quartiles, and aggregating statistics. CTEs were also used for creating temporary views to segment data and perform ranking.
- **Window Functions**: Applied window functions like `RANK()` and `NTILE()` to calculate the ranking of songs based on streams and divide them into quartiles. This was also used for calculating percentiles and ranking within partitions to analyze engagement metrics.
- **Aggregate Functions**: Used aggregate functions like `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, and `STDDEV()` to calculate key metrics such as average streams, the number of songs per category, and statistical variance across different groups (e.g., BPM ranges and performance quartiles).
- **Cross Joins**: Used `CROSS JOIN` to combine aggregate statistics (such as average BPM and streams) with song data, ensuring consistency when performing analysis across all tracks, regardless of groupings.
- **Conditional Aggregation**: Utilized `CASE` statements for conditional aggregation to categorize songs into performance buckets, such as high/low engagement based on specific criteria (streams, BPM, energy, etc.).
- **Percentile Calculations**: Employed `PERCENTILE_CONT()` to calculate percentiles and split songs into performance buckets. This was particularly useful for analyzing top-performing songs (e.g., top 25% in streams).
- **Correlation Functions**: Used `CORR()` to calculate the correlation between streaming performance and song attributes (such as BPM, energy, danceability, etc.) to identify significant relationships between song features and streaming success.
- **Z-Scores**: Calculated Z-scores for various song metrics (e.g., BPM, streams, energy) to detect outliers and standardize the data for comparison across different song characteristics.
- **Grouping and Segmentation**: Used grouping techniques and segmentation based on BPM ranges and performance quartiles to analyze the effects of different attributes on streaming success. This helped identify trends and patterns within specific categories.
- **Performance Buckets**: Created performance buckets (quartiles) based on streaming metrics using `NTILE()` for better insight into how songs perform relative to others in terms of engagement (streams, likes, comments, etc.).
- **Statistical Analysis**: While the Kruskal-Wallis test is not used in this project, statistical analysis techniques like calculating Z-scores and percentiles were crucial in evaluating song performance and detecting significant differences across groups.
- **Data Transformation**: Applied transformations for segmenting songs based on their attributes (e.g., grouping by BPM ranges) and for calculating summary statistics across multiple metrics. This enabled a more granular analysis of song attributes in relation to streaming performance.
