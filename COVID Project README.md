- **Infection Rates by Country**: Mapped the percentage of the population infected in various countries.
- **Mortality Analysis**: Analyzed total deaths by continent and provided insights into mortality rates.
- **Population and Vaccination Rates**: Examined the relationship between population figures and vaccination rates across different countries.

## Skills Used:
- **SQL Queries**: Employed joins, CTEs, window functions, and aggregate functions for data extraction and preparation.
- **Data Transformation**: Converted and cleaned data within SQL and Excel to prepare for visualization.
- **Tableau Visualization**: Created interactive dashboards to depict the pandemic's impact visually.
