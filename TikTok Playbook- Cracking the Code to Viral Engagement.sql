/*
The TikTok Playbook: Cracking the Code to Viral Engagement 

Skills used: 
- **Joins**: Used for combining data from multiple rows within the same table (`self-join`), and for combining data across tables using `INNER JOIN`.
- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**: Implemented to simplify complex queries and calculations such as aggregating data, segmenting by video duration, and calculating statistics.
- **Window Functions**: Applied `RANK()` and `PERCENTILE_CONT()` for ranking video engagement metrics and calculating percentiles within partitions.
- **Aggregate Functions**: Used `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, and `AVG()` to calculate metrics like sum of ranks, group sizes, and video counts across specific conditions.
- **Creating Views**: Employed temporary views using CTEs to organize data into segments such as engagement categories and rank statistics.
- **Converting Data Types**: Applied necessary conversions when dealing with hardcoded values and transformations for statistical formulas like Kruskal-Wallis.
- **Cross Joins**: Used `CROSS JOIN` for combining fixed results from hardcoded tables (e.g., rank statistics) with dynamic data.
- **Percentile Calculations**: Used `PERCENTILE_CONT()` for calculating thresholds to segment engagement metrics (views, likes, shares, comments) into high and low categories.
- **Advanced Statistical Functions**: Implemented advanced statistical analysis with the Kruskal-Wallis test to calculate H-statistics.
- **Dynamic Case Statements**: Utilized `CASE` for conditional aggregation and segmentation, such as categorizing engagement as 'High' or 'Low' based on video metrics.
