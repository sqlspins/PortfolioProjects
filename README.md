# Portfolio Projects Repository

Welcome to my Portfolio Repository! ðŸš€

This repository contains the code, queries, and documentation for various projects Iâ€™ve created to showcase my skills in data analysis, visualization, and problem-solving across different domains.

Feel free to explore, adapt, and build on these projects to uncover new insights. Whether youâ€™re here to evaluate my work or gain inspiration for your own projects, I hope you find these resources valuable.
