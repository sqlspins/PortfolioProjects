# The TikTok Playbook: Cracking the Code to Viral Engagement

This project delves into TikTok engagement metrics, analyzing how various video attributes (such as video duration, content type, and user verification status) influence a video's success. By segmenting videos into performance categories and examining key engagement metrics, this work uncovers the factors driving viral success on TikTok.

## Key Insights:
- **Content-Type Segmentation**: Analyzed how content type (claim vs. opinion) affects video engagement.
- **Verified vs. Non-Verified**: Investigated the impact of user verification status on video performance.
- **Engagement Correlations**: Studied the relationship between video attributes (likes, shares, comments) and views to identify the most influential factors.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Applied **VADER** sentiment analysis to assess the emotional tone of video captions and its effect on engagement, uncovering key insights into how sentiment influences user interaction.
  
## Skills Used:
- **Data Segmentation & Categorization**: Applied SQL techniques to categorize videos based on content type, user attributes, and performance metrics.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Used **correlation analysis** and **ranking techniques** to assess relationships between various engagement metrics and video performance.
- **Strategic Thinking**: Focused on identifying key trends and actionable insights for improving TikTok engagement, with recommendations for content creators and marketers.
- **Sentiment Analysis with VADER**: Used **Python and VADER** for sentiment analysis on video captions, linking sentiment polarity (positive, negative, neutral) to engagement outcomes.
- **Data Transformation & Cleaning**: Transformed raw data for analysis by calculating engagement metrics and segmenting by percentile ranks.
- **Advanced SQL Functions**: Leveraged **window functions** (e.g., `RANK()`, `NTILE()`, `PERCENTILE_CONT()`) to rank videos and calculate performance thresholds.
- **Cross-Platform Analysis**: Analyzed TikTok data across multiple dimensions, including video length, user status, and sentiment, to provide a holistic view of performance.
- **Actionable Business Recommendations**: Based on the conclusions, offered strategic recommendations for improving TikTok content and user engagement, guiding content creation and marketing strategies.
